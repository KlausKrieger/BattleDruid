        <item >You are Jashiro, a young druid apprentice, found unconscious and heavily wounded by wizards of the mages guild. \nHaving no memory of your former life, you where taken to their academy and affiliated in their guild as a novice, giving you the chance to study their arts (and them the chance to study you). \nYour snobby classmates are taunting you permanently as an uncivilized and sniffy barbarian. \nSomeday - in the heat of the moment - you challenged Fred, a bully schoolfellow, to a (secret and illegal) duel. \nLuckily it is up to you to choose the time of the duel, so choose wisely and prepare yourself - and hope, the professors won\'t take notice.</item>

        <item >You defeated Fred, who now has learnt not to insult you any more. \nBut you got some hair burnt during your last fight and another schoolmate, named Ivy, still continues to make (not so) funny jokes about your appearance. \nMaybe you should teach her a lesson, too.</item>
        <item >Ivy finally goes down and the coldness vanishes. \nMognor, another classmate and boyfriend of Ivy now gets really furious. \nHe didn\'t think you could beat her, and now he saw her suffer and collapse. \nYou have found a new enemy. If you fight him too, you will have duelled all your classmates in this first year of apprenticeship. \nAnd Mognor won\'t let you get off lightly.</item>
        <item >You defeated Mognor and thus duelled all classmates of your first year apprenticeship. \nAccording to the house rules of the academy, you will have some serious problems if the professors hear about that. \nBut it seems that at this time, only the schoolmates know about your deeds, and they spread within them: \nTonkar, a second year apprentice, mocks you by telling the others you are the champion of the \'battle of babies\'.</item>
        <item >You defeated Tonkar. Who is next?</item>
